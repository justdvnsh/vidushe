												Aah Babe ! Finally a birthday gift I can give to tell the world about my feelings . Its been too long. I have been waiting too long for this .
												I have always wanted to tell the world how much I love you . I have so much to say , that I am actully confused , from where I should start with.
												But lets start from the very beginning . Class 9th , where It all started . I was a random boy in a random class . I hated school ( you know that by now ).
												I bunked school a lot, until I saw you . I remember the first time I saw you at the bus stand , seamlessly looking for your school bus , I was awstruck .
												I remember how the sunlight was pouring on your hair , making it shine golden bright. I remember, how the cheeks were as red as a blossom . I remember, how 
												those lips were shining as a diamond , I wanted to kiss so bad . I remember, how you were coming towards me . The bus stand was crowded as hell , but All I 
												could see was you. No skill of mine neither any artist in this world could have doubted , how gorgeous you were . The way you were walking towards me , I wanted to kneel
												before you. The way you passed by me , giving me a slight look by the side of your eyes. I knew it back then , I had fallen for you. The things I felt, I think I would
												need a spare heart to feel the things that I felt. One heart is just not enough to feel you, to love you . I knew it back then , I have a reason now , to come to school everyday.
												I came to school most of the time , just to see you. You were in a different class , back then , so , the only time I could see you was during the home time, when I sneakly watched you
												going home . This was my everyday routine . Back then , neither of us knew each other . This continued till class 10th .

												<p class="img__description"><b>"At first I was afraid to meet you, Then I was afraid to hug you, Then I was afraid to love you. Now I am afraid to lose you ."</b><br/>
												Class Xth, wasn't different either. You didnt know me , I still used to watch you go home . The daily struggle . The hardcore romance . Then came the time of toppers photograph, the time
												when the results came , and we had our photos clicked in the media . The photo was being clicked in the pre-primary area , where there were lots of swings, and I was sitting at the left most
												corner, when you walked across me, and I was mesmerized by how beautiful you were looking . I wished , I could just hold you tight , and not let you go . But, that time also flew , and here we 
												were in 11th. "Damn, she's is a different class. Yet again . Man, we will be together, I know . " - I said, to one of my friends back then . "Forget her man, She's way too out of your league." - 
												He exclaimed. "I don't care . I'll make my own league . We are meant to be together. I know it ." - I said . Things worked out. Our classes got shuffled, all the toppers in one section . And , here
												you were. In my class . Who says , "Marks don't matter". Well in my case they did, getting me into the same class as you . I remember , the first time you came into my class , you sat right behind me. 
												And we talked for the whole period. We clicked instantly. I knew it , we would , I had no doubts about that . I was roaming the whole school as a stud , knowing that I have progressed . I have atleast
												made you a friend now . But still we weren't talking like everyday. And we were instructed to sit in rows according to our roll numbers , so you went off to a completely different row, The last one. But I had
												my friend there. I exchanged seats with him, and then gradually made you a good friend . Good enough to start sitting with you. Your bench partner . We got along pretty well . We talked for hours . You remember , how
												we have been punished several times , for talking too much in the class . Mostly in Prashant's sirs class . Physics . How I was scolded by Jayanti ma'am for talking too much . But Fuck it. Who cares. We were having a great
												time . I was getting way too much involved into you . And I was liking it more than anything . I haven't told this to you yet. But I already knew that you were still hooked onto Asad . And I was trying my best to get you out 
												of that zone , But I was failing everytime . You were too involved into Asad, and that used to break me into pieces, but I was constantly keeping myself steady. And time flew like butterflies . One time it is the most beautiful 
												in your hands , and the next time you see, its gone . So was class 11th. I was getting more and more poetical day by day .

													Then came class 12th - The final year. This was my chance . I was too sure to tell you I loved you. But I was taking my time . For when I thought , you have somewhat overcame Asad, I thought I should go for it, but little did I knew , once again destiny will play its role. The day I decided to tell you , how much I love you, was the day 
													when you decided to tell me that , You loved Shubham . <b>Woosh !</b>, Mind blown . What should I say. "Well , that's great . He loves you back ??" - I said. "Don't know, guess he does. Will ask him." - You said . Ripped my heart into a
													a million pieces . "But calm down man, you are meant to be together."- I consoled myself. Day by day , you only talked about him and how he cares for you . "The way you are , na Vidushe, anyone would love you, but no one will ever love you like me. No one would be as crazy for you as me." -
													I thought in my head. But I distanced myself from you, as it was hard for me to see you with him . I didn't hate shubham , But I didn't lik him either . That was the time , I thought I was behaving like a sissy, and need to get over it.
													You are not my girlfriend , and I shouln't be so possesive about you . So, I distanced myself. But I couldn't see you with him. Fast forwarding to the day , when we went on a school trip to Blue World . All I wanted was to be with you . Have a great time .
													We reached blue world . I had one of the favourite rides in mind, I wanted to go on with you . And I had wanted to go on that ride , for a very very long time . So here we were, sitting besides each other on that ride. And you had saved a seat beside you on the other side of you, for shubham, 
													but one of our school teachers sat there, and I remember , how upset you got , cause you wanted to sit with shubham . I got off that ride , saying "I dont want to ride , I dont like it", but because I wanted to see you happy . We went on a boat ride , but you
													didn't came . Few moments later , you called shubham , That you are scared . I immediately turned the boat , rowed the boat as fast as I could , jumped on to see you , and you ran to shubham . That was the time I could deeply feel my heart. The pain , I had never experienced it before .
